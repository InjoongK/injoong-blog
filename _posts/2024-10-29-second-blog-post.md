author: Injoong Kim
description: "Do bigger players really hit more home runs? To answer this, I used web scraping to gather data on the height, weight, and home run stats of the 200 MLB players in 2023! Through this project, I hope you’ll get more familiar with web scraping and maybe even learn a few tips for your own data adventures. Come check it out!"

### Introduction
<p>Baseball is all about the numbers, and fans love to talk about stats. One big question is whether a player’s size makes a difference in hitting home runs. Do taller and heavier players really hit more homers, or is that just a stereotype?</p>
<p>To find out, I decided to use web scraping which is a handy tool in data science that helps us collect information from websites. I’ll be gathering data on MLB players’ heights, weights, and home run counts from a reliable website. This project is a great way to practice web scraping and satisfy a curiosity about how size might affect a player’s batting performance.</p>

### What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is a method for automatically gathering information from websites. Instead of manually copying data from a webpage, web scraping uses a program to access the webpage, find the specific information you’re looking for (like text, images, or tables), and save it in a structured format, such as a spreadsheet or database. This technique is especially useful for collecting large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, making it a powerful tool in data analysis, research, and many other fields.


### Data Collection Process
- **Algorithms Learn from Data**: Machine learning works by studying lots of data to find patterns. It's like teaching a computer by showing it examples. The more it learns, the better it gets at making predictions.
- **Decision-Making**: Once trained, the model can make predictions or decisions based on new data. Instead of following predefined rules, it uses statistical relationships learned during training to infer outcomes, continuously improving its accuracy over time.

- **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the model is trained using labeled data, meaning each input comes with the correct output. The model learns by comparing its predictions to the actual labels and adjusting until it can accurately predict outcomes.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: In unsupervised learning, the computer gets data without any labels. It has to figure out patterns all by itself, like trying to group things that are similar. 
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning involves training a model to make decisions through trial and error, and receiving feedback through rewards or penalties.

### Conclusion
In summary, deep learning is an advanced subset of machine learning, extending its capabilities through deep neural networks. Each has its strengths: machine learning is effective for tasks with smaller datasets and simpler algorithms, while deep learning excels in handling large datasets and more complex tasks. As both technologies continue to evolve, they are driving significant advancements in AI, shaping innovations in industries such as healthcare, autonomous systems, and natural language processing.
