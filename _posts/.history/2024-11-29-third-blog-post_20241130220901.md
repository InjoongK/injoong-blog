From the previous blog, we explored MLB player performance for the 2023 season, focusing on home run efficiency and pure batting power. In this blog, I will share some insights from our last blog, and I'm going to introduce an app called Streamlit that uses Python to help us explore our dataset more interactively.

## Key Insights from the Data
#### 1. Who are the most efficient power hitters?
One key metric I explored is Home Runs per At Bat (HR/AB), which highlights batters' efficiency in hitting home runs relative to their opportunities at the plate. For example, **Aaron Judge** emerged as a top performer, with a remarkable HR/AB rate that sets them apart from their peers.

The visualization below showcases the top players ranked by HR/AB, offering a glimpse into how certain players dominate this efficiency metric.

#### 2. Isolated Power (ISO) reveals a different angle
While HR/AB emphasizes efficiency, Isolated Power (ISO) provides insights into a batter’s raw slugging potential by focusing on extra-base hits. Interestingly, some players who excel in HR/AB rank lower in ISO, reflecting differences in overall hitting styles and strategies.

Through the comparison of these metrics, I uncovered patterns that suggest the coexistence of diverse skill sets among MLB's top hitters.

#### 3. Correlation between HR/AB and ISO
To tie these metrics together, I analyzed the correlation between HR/AB and ISO. The scatterplot below shows a positive trend, indicating that players with higher HR/AB often have strong ISO values. However, outliers also exist, illustrating the unique approaches players take to achieve success at the plate.

## Introducing the Streamlit App
### Purpose and Features
The MLB Power Hitting Analysis App is designed to empower baseball enthusiasts, analysts, and coaches to explore MLB hitting metrics interactively. Whether you want to identify top performers, analyze team dynamics, or customize your own analyses, this app offers a user-friendly platform to dive into the data.

### Interactive Features
The Streamlit app offers the following interactive features.

#### Power Metrics Overview
- **Top Players by HR/AB & ISO**: View rankings and stats of players by their Home Runs per At Bat (HR/AB) and Isolated Power (ISO). **Number of players to display** allows users to control how many top-performing players to show in the Power Metrics Overview section. By entering a value, users can adjust the number of players displayed in the rankings based on metrics like Home Runs per At Bat (HR/AB) or Isolated Power (ISO). The number can be adjusted between 1 and the total number of players in the dataset.
- **Player Search**: Let users search for specific players by name. Users can type a player's name in the search box, and the app will show a list of matching players. If there are multiple results, users can select the player they are interested in, and the app will display detailed stats for that player. If no matches are found, the app will prompt users to try another search.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Visualize the relationship between Home Runs per At Bat (HR/AB) and Isolated Power (ISO) using a scatter plot. This analysis helps users explore how these two power-hitting metrics are related. The app also includes a trendline that highlights any patterns in the data, allowing users to identify potential correlations between a player's efficiency in hitting home runs and their overall power.

#### Team Power Analysis
The Team Power Analysis feature allows users to compare MLB teams based on various power metrics. Users can select between Average HR/AB, Average ISO, or Total Home Runs to analyze and compare team performance. The app presents these metrics in bar charts, helping users identify which teams excel in specific areas, such as hitting home runs efficiently or generating isolated power.

#### Custom Analysis
The Custom Analysis feature in the app allows users to create their own visualizations by selecting metrics for both the X and Y axes. For example, users can compare any two metrics, such as Home Runs vs. Batting Average or ISO vs. Age, to explore relationships between them. This feature also includes a regression line to reveal trends, helping users uncover patterns in the data.

## What’s Next?
In this blog post, I explored MLB player performance for the 2023 season, focusing on home run efficiency and pure batting power, but now it’s your turn to dive deeper! Can you identify hidden trends in the data that I may have missed? Or perhaps you can explore how player attributes beyond just HR/AB and ISO  influence their power metrics. Challenge yourself to experiment with different combinations of metrics and share your findings.

And you can easily make your own streamlit app, too. See the <a href=https://docs.streamlit.io/> document tab on the Streamlit website </a>.
